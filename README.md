# K-means-ArcGIS-tool
This repository contains tool for K means clustering of point shape files in ArcGIS. The tool is optimized using the K means ++ algorithm.
In addition, it includes a tool for calculating the convex hull of each cluster of points, as well as a feature for calculating the average silhouette score of different values of K (still in progress). 

This project was created as part of the requirements for my Geospatial Software Design class at the University of Pennsylvania.The goal of the project is to provide a simple and easy to use clustering tool in ArcGIS, that could be used on point type shapefiles.

Some potential applications of this tool include incident analysis, such as traffic accidents and crime.
